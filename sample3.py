I believe you're referring to the 2015 film "The Revenant," which is often informally referred to as "The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge." This movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character, Hugh Glass, and is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. The film is inspired by the life of frontiersman Hugh Glass and is loosely based on Michael Punke's novel of the same name.
The Revenant tells the harrowing story of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman and fur trapper who is severely injured and left for dead by members of his expedition team after a brutal bear attack. Despite his injuries and against all odds, Glass survives and embarks on a grueling journey through the wilderness to seek revenge against those who abandoned him and killed his son.
The movie is known for its stunning cinematography, with many scenes shot in remote and challenging locations. It also gained attention for Leonardo DiCaprio's powerful performance, which earned him his first Academy Award for Best Actor.
The story is a tale of survival, resilience, and the indomitable human spirit set against the backdrop of the American wilderness in the early 19th century. It's a visually and emotionally gripping film that explores themes of revenge, survival, and the bond between a father and his son.
